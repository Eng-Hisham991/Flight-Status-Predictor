## Background 

How many flights are delayed/cancelled each year? We built a classifier using machine learning techniques that predicts whether your flight will be delayed or normal based on the airline, the destination city, the delay, the month, and the year leaving IAH in houston. 

## Model Details 

## Visualizations 

The visualizations were done on tableau, posted on tableau public, and incorporated into the HTML. 

## Flask App 

The Flask app is in direct communication with the model & the JavaScript file and the HTML file to predict the outcome based on the user input into the website.
